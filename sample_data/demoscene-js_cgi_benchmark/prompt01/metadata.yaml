      prompt: using html , svg and vanila js create a scene that looks like The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Its a large wave asian style of art. But your only allowed to use SVG and 1 color. Keep the code small. Put it all into one file. Its a static image no animations.

      prompt: create an svg tree made from simple fractal formulas with randomness build it. Colors are grey lines on black background. Only generate a new tree on load. Use the full window for drawing. Do not clip the tree on the edge of the screen. Fade out the lines as you get towards the leaves. Try to write this using as little code as possible.  Do not use any libraries only vanila js is allowed. I will look at the result only in chrome v8.

      prompt: create an svg animation of a wire frame torus with the wire mesh . Colors are grey lines on black background. Try to write this using as little code as possible. Randomize the density of the wire mesh. Randomize the angle of the torus with respect to the horizontal and vertical. Also randomize the Major Radius   and Minor Radius  such that the hole in the middle changes. Choose an angle and then animate a rotation of the torus.   Do not use any libraries only vanila js is allowed. I will look at the result only in chrome v8.

      prompt: Procedurally generate a 3d fractal call ed   the Menger sponge (also known as the Menger cube, Menger universal curve, Sierpinski cube, or Sierpinski sponge .  .   Use only vanila js with webgl. Change the colors of the faces as you go deeper into the fractal.  This fractal mathematically has a Hausdorff dimension of  {\displaystyle \log _{3}8}   . Think about how to do this, list yourself several options its not that easy. the Menger sponge has an infinite surface area and zero volume so you need to generate it procedurally and potentially set an arbitrary cutoff limit on how deep the fractal will go . I will look at the result only in chrome v8. Put everything into one index.html file.
