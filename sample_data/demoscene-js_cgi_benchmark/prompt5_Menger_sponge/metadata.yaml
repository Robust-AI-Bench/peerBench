prompt:  Procedurally generate a 3d fractal call ed   the Menger sponge (also known as the Menger cube, Menger universal curve, Sierpinski cube, or Sierpinski sponge .  .   Use only vanila js with webgl. Change the colors of the faces as you go deeper into the fractal.  This fractal mathematically has a Hausdorff dimension of  {\displaystyle \log _{3}8}   . Think about how to do this, list yourself several options its not that easy. the Menger sponge has an infinite surface area and zero volume so you need to generate it procedurally and potentially set an arbitrary cutoff limit on how deep the fractal will go . I will look at the result only in chrome v8. Put everything into one index.html file.
